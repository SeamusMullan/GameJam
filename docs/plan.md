# General Plan

## Goals

- Produce a clear, playable prototype that demonstrates core mechanics.
- Finish a vertical slice that can be shown to others.

## Scope

- Core gameplay loop (1–2 minutes playtime).
- Basic art and sound (placeholder assets allowed).
- Polished controls and a simple UI.

## Constraints

- Timebox: the jam duration (e.g., 48–72 hours).
- Team size and available skills.

## Deliverables

- Build (Windows/macOS/Linux or web export).
- Short demo video and instructions.
- Source repository with a build script.

## Milestones

- Day 0 — Idea & team formation
- Day 0–1 — Prototype core mechanics
- Day 1–2 — Add content and polish
- Final hours — Bugfixes, build, and upload

## Tooling

- Engine: (e.g., Godot/Unity/Phaser)
- Version control: GitHub
- Communication: Discord/Slack

## Success Criteria

- Playable vertical slice completed.
- Team able to present the game within time.

## Risks & Mitigations

- Scope creep: prioritize MVP features first.
- Burnout: schedule short breaks and rotate tasks.
