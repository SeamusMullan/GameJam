# Team & Roles

Define clear roles so contributors know responsibilities.

- **Producer / Lead:** Keeps schedule, priorities, and scope in check.
- **Programmers:** Implement gameplay, systems, and builds.
- **Artists:** Sprites, UI, animations, and visual polish.
- **Audio:** Music, SFX, and mixing.
- **QA / Playtesters:** Rapid feedback and bug reports.

Consider rotating people between tasks to avoid burnout and cross-train skills.
